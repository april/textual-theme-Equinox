=======================

An update to the nox theme for Textual 5:

![Preview Image](http://i.imgur.com/xgOvbEA.png)
(with Monaco 11pt, the recommended font)

textual includes the following changes:
* Update the nick color generation to avoid garish/high-contrast colors (red on black), or low-contrast (dark blue on black)
* Nick consolidation, where consecutive message from the same person only cause their nick to appear once
* Disabling the default behavior of Textual to jump down to the bottom of a view (channel) when it becomes active
* Update the stylesheet to make the text mildly less contrasty (more black to background, more gray to text), other tweaks

Changes should only appear in design.css, scripts,js, LICENSE, and README.md, but this is a complete theme.
