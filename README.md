textual-technical-theme
=======================

An update to the nox theme for Textual 5, with the following changes:
* Update the stylesheet to make the text mildly less contrasty (more black to background, more gray to text)
* Update the nick color generation to avoid garish/high-contrast colors (red on black), or low-contrast (dark blue on black)
* Nick consolidation, where consecutive message from the same person only cause their nick to appear once
* Disabling the default behavior of Textual to jump down to the bottom of a view (channel) when it becomes active
